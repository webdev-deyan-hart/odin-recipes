# odin-recipes

This project will show what skills I have so far learned from the Odin Project!

The website itself is going to be barebones, some might even call it 'brutalist'. This will contain all sorts of elements of HTML and techinically, the know-how of Git/GitHub.

We shall see how this goes. Good luck, me!
